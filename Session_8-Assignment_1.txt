Problem​ ​Statement​ ​1:

Blood glucose levels for obese patients have a mean of 100 with a standard deviation of
15. A researcher thinks that a diet high in raw cornstarch will have a positive effect on
blood glucose levels. A sample of 36 patients who have tried the raw cornstarch diet
have a mean glucose level of 108. Test the hypothesis that the raw cornstarch had an
effect or not.


Ans ) 

	claim  : Blood glucose levels for obese patients have a mean of 100 ,  that is Mu  = 100 thats H(0) null hypothesis
	Opp : Mu not equal 100 , H(1) alternative Hypothesis

	Population Standard Deviation : 15

	Sample Size = Number of Patients = 36 

	Sample mean = X-bar = 108

	Z-score = ( X-bar - Mu ) / (sigma/sqrt(sample size))

	Z-Score = (108-100)/(15/sqrt(36)) = 8/2.5 = 3.2

	Note : this is two tail test 

	Significance level taken as 0.5  so alpha/2 = 0.025  = z critical value is 1.96 , since out calculated z-score is above 1.96 , we are
	rejecting the null hypothesis , so we are accepting that raw cornstarch had an effect.
